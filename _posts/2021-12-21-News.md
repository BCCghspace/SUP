## Mainstream Media (Print)
In order to explore print mainstream news sources' recent coverage of abortion, we used data from [News API](https://newsapi.org/). We pulled headlines and article text containing the word "abortion" for the a one month period of time from November 15th, 2021 to December 15, 2021.

Below is a chart showing the number of articles mentioning abortion by source and date. 

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```
