## Mainstream Media (Print)
In order to explore print mainstream news sources' recent coverage of abortion, we used data from [News API](https://newsapi.org/). We pulled headlines and article text containing the word "abortion" for the a one month period of time from November 15th, 2021 to December 15, 2021.

Below is a chart showing the number of articles mentioning abortion by source and date. These articles were then ranked by their polarity and subjectivity. Polarity measures how positive an article is and ranges from 1 being positive to -1 being negative. The subjectivity of the articles measures how subjective they are, ranging from 0 to 1. Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas objective statements stick to facts.

The New York Times had the most articles during our search period that mentioned abortion. Lifehacker, Gizmodo, and CNN all had one article each. The New York Times had a peak in mentions on Thursday, December 2nd, 2021. This was the day after the Supreme Court argued *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.* This case questions the legality of Mississippi's Gestational Age Act that bans abortions after 15 weeks. The uptick in mentions is likely due to the coverage of the case. 

The sentiment analysis showed that the New York Times and Lifehacker had a more positive coverage while Gizmodo had more negative coverage. Lifehacker had the most subjective coverage of abortion with a polarity score just under 0.40.
