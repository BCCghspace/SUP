## Mainstream Media (GDELT)

This API reports coverage of topics across major broadcast news channels, including but not limited to PBS, CNN, FOX, and BBC. Topics are defined by the userâ€™s text search of federally required closed captioning, and may be further queried by timeframe, date format, and data format. Accessing GDELT allowed us to view the difference in news coverage surrounding abortion between print and tv media, as well as compared with social media. The following chart shows the percentage of the total daily news coverage that the network was talking about abortion by day by broadcast network. Additionally, the mean percentage of total daily news coverage by network is shown.

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```

## Notes

- See the [raw source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2021/github-pages-starter/main/_posts/2021-11-29-measles-charts.md) of this post for details on how these charts were embedded.
- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2021/week-13/blob/main/lecture-13A.ipynb) for the code that produced these plots.

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**
